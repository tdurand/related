In the Indexing section, we saw that the related items POST document is constructed in to many small documents and stored in elasticsearch.
These tiny documents contain the `related-with` field.  It is this json element `related-with`, that will be used during searching, to provide faceting.  
This faceting that allows us to say:

* For this id, what are the 5 top most frequently **related-with** ids.

For example for previously indexed POST request:

    curl -H"Content-Type:text/json" -XPOST -v http://localhost:8080/indexing/index -d '
    {
       "channel":"de",
       "site":"amazon",
       "items":[
          {
             "id":"1",
             "type":"map"
          },
          {
             "id":"2",
             "type":"compass"
          },
          {
             "id":"3",
             "type":"torch"
          },
          {
             "id":"4",
             "type":"torch",
             "channel":"uk"
          }
       ]
    }'

The search web application is then called to request the frequently related items for a product (Item with id 1 in this case):

    curl -v -N http://10.0.1.29:8080/searching/frequentlyrelatedto/1

This returns json data containing the list of items (their id's) that are frequently related to that item:

    {
        "response_time": "2", 
        "results": [
            {
                "frequency": "1", 
                "id": "4"
            }, 
            {
                "frequency": "1", 
                "id": "3"
            }, 
            {
                "frequency": "1", 
                "id": "2"
            }
        ], 
        "size": "3", 
        "storage_response_time": "0"
}
