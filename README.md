**Relateit** is a simple and easy way to relate one item to several others.  Once several items are related to other items you can enquire:  For this item, what are the most frequently related items.  

This can be used on a web site to associate the items the people are purchasing.  If a person purchases the books 'Java Performance Tuning', 'Akka Concurrency' and 'Java concurrency in practice' at the same time.  When a second user is browsing 'Java Performance Tuning', you can present that user with related items that this book is frequently purchased with.

This application has 3 parts to it:

* A Indexing Web Application
* A Searching Web Application
* [Elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/ "Elasticsearch") backend

The indexing and searching components make use of the [Disruptor](https://github.com/LMAX-Exchange/disruptor "Disruptor") library.  Whilst the Indexing and Searching components do not need to directly be used, they provide a means of batching indexing and searching requests.


## Indexing Overview ##

The index web application is POSTed data containing the related items:

    curl -H"Content-Type:text/json" -XPOST -v http://localhost:8080/indexing/index -d '
    {
       "channel":"de",
       "site":"amazon",
       "items":[
          {
             "id":"1",
             "type":"map"
          },
          {
             "id":"2",
             "type":"compass"
          },
          {
             "id":"3",
             "type":"torch"
          }
       ]
    }'

The indexing application returns a 202 accepted status code to the client that issued the indexing request.  This indicate to the client that the request has been accepted for processing and indexing (this doesn't mean the json data is valid.  It just means the POST data is a valid binary payload).  

It is at this point the POSTed data is assembled into several documents.  For example, for the above request; 3 JSON documents will be assembled and submitted to elasticsearch for storage and indexing:

    {
        "id": "1" ,
        "date": "2013-12-24T17:44:41.943Z",
        "related-with": [ "2","3"],
        "type": "map",
        "site": "amazon",
        "channel": "de"
    }

    {
        "id": "2" ,
        "date": "2013-12-24T17:44:41.943Z",
        "related-with": [ "1","3"],
        "type": "compass",
        "site": "amazon",
        "channel": "de"
    }

    {
        "id": "3" ,
        "date": "2013-12-24T17:44:41.943Z",
        "related-with": [ "1","2"],
        "type": "torch",
        "site": "amazon",
        "channel": "de"
    }

The json element "related-with", will be used during search, to provide faceting information.  It is this facet that allows us to say:

* For this id, what are the 5 top most frequently **related-with** ids.

The search web application is then called to request the frequently related items for a product (a GET request):

    curl -v -N http://10.0.1.29:8080/searching/frequentlyrelatedto/1

Which returns json data containing the list of items (their id's) that are frequently related to that item

Note the search does not only provide the ability to search on the id.  It allows you to filter the result based on a property of the indexed document.  For example:

    {
        "id": "3" ,
        "date": "2013-12-24T17:44:41.943Z",
        "related-with": [ "1","2"],
        "type": "torch",
        "site": "amazon",
        "channel": "de"
    }

In the above, there are 3 extra elements that can be searched on:

* type
* site
* channel

As a result you can say.  Give with the frequently related product that are mostly purchased with product **1**, filtered the results to reduce to "touches":

    curl -v -N http://10.0.1.29:8080/searching/frequentlyrelatedto/1?type=torch

Currently the search result just returns the id's of the related items, and the frequency by which it was related with the searched for item it.   It *DOES NOT* return the matching document's information.  This doesn't mean in the future it will not return the matching document details.
